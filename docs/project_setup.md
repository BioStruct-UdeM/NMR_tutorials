# Setting up a project in CcpNmr

## Saving the project

Once your first spectrum is [loaded](../ccpnmr_open_spectrum/), and its
[peaks picked](../ccpnmr_pick_peaks/), you can now save your CcpNmr
project (`Project > Save`) in your preferred location.

![Project Save](../img/ccpnmr/project_save-as.png)

It will be easier to manage your multi-spectra project later by
re-opening the project instead of re-opening each individual spectrum.
Also, all the parameters (colours, peaks, referencing *etc*.) are saved
along with the project.

If it is the first time you save a project, CcpNmr will ask you to
register. That is ok, but DO NOT USE ACCENTS in the text for the
registration as it will break CcpNmr. For example, use Universite de
Montreal instead of Université de Montréal.
