## What is NMR?

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a spectroscopic approach to observe
local magnetic fields around certain nuclei being intrinsically
magnetic. The NMR signals are generated by exciting nuclei with radio
frequencies while being submitted to an external magnetic field. This is
typically done in aqueous solution, but can also be performed with solid
samples (see [solid-state
NMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_nuclear_magnetic_resonance)).

More specifically, in structural biology, it is a method used for the
determination of the three-dimensional molecular structure and dynamics
of proteins and nucleic acids at atomic resolution. The results obtained
from these measurements provide information about:

-   How atoms are linked chemically (primary structure)
-   How close atoms are positioned in space (secondary, tertiary
    structure)
-   How rapidly they move with respect to each other

Among the techniques used to determine the structure of biomolecules at
atomic resolution, NMR spectroscopy offers certain unique advantages,
including (i) the possibility to study the dynamics of biomolecular
folding and internal mobility over a wide range of timescales (from
pico- to millisecond) and (ii) the capability to investigate intra- and
intermolecular interactions under physiological conditions ([Sugiki *et
al*
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037017300053?via%3Dihub)).

### Software required

The instructions on how to install individual softwares on your personal
computer are details on their respective websites.

-   [TopSpin](https://www.bruker.com/products/mr/nmr/nmr-software/nmr-software/topspin/overview.html)
-   [CcpNmr

You also need to get the latest updates available from ccpNMR Analysis
further down on their website.

Alternatively, the Structural Biology Platform has computers available
where recent versions of these softwares are installed (TopSpin is only
available on the computers controlling the spectrometers). Access to the
computer room is controlled by access codes. Contact [Normand
